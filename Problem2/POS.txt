KUALA LUMPUR (Oct 26): The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC)’s move to freeze all new courier service licences for two years has been welcome as positive for the industry as a whole. 
GD Express Carrier Bhd (GDEX) managing director and group chief executive officer (CEO) Teong Teck Lean told theedgemarkets.com that while the move would not have any impact on GDEX as there are already many courier companies in the market, it is a good indication that the regulator is taking a serious look at the industry. 
According to Teong, who is also the president of the Association of Malaysian Express Carriers (AMEC), there are currently more than 111 players in the market.
However, he opined that competition would remain stiff, with new start-ups backed by huge funds fuelling their growth and volume by dumping service prices.
“As Malaysia has ambitions to be a regional hub for logistics, especially e-commerce logistics, we need a few regional champions in Malaysia. The freezing of new licences is the first step to make the industry an important enabler of e-commerce in the region,” he said, adding that the regulator should set a level playing field for local companies.
According to Teong, the MCMC is currently engaging with Pemandu Associates Sdn Bhd to assist the industry to chart a road map for a sustainable, reliable and healthy industry to support the growth of e-commerce in Malaysia and the region.
Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research analyst Nazira Abdulla also opined that the MCMC's move is positive for the industry.
“Competition among courier services is stiff as most e-commerce websites have their own courier services. It is good to know that no more new players are coming in,” she said.  
Concuring with Teong, Nazira opined that the market would remain stiff, with more than 111 players operating.
“However, I think Pos Malaysia [Bhd] will still be the player with the largest network,” she said, adding that the group's management had indicated an increase in volume amid the conditional movement control order (CMCO).
The MCMC said today that the regulator had frozen all new courier service licences for two years. The freeze on new licences is effective for the period of Sept 14, 2020 to Sept 15, 2022.
It said the decision was made under the licensing provision of the Postal Services Act 2012, and may be reviewed on a basis of needs.

KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 10): Microlink Solutions Bhd is developing an insurance policy renewal digital platform and innovation channel for Pos Malaysia Bhd over a nine-month period.
In a bourse filing today, Microlink said it received a letter of award (LOA) from Pos Malaysia last Friday for the project. Under the agreement, the national postal company will share 12% of its net revenue generated from the software usage with Microlink.
The duration of the project encompasses three months of development and deployment, with another six months for the Pilot Go-Live stage, it added.
Microlink will need to integrate the platform with Pos Malaysia's existing digital channel.
"The services will commence from the date of acceptance of the LOA," Microlink said.
Microlink shares closed up two sen or 1.04% at RM1.95 today, bringing a market capitalisation of RM359 million.

KUALA LUMPUR (May 19): Pos Malaysia Bhd said while there is an increase in parcel volume during the country’s movement control order (MCO) period, the company’s other businesses including mail and international parcels, besides operations under Pos Aviation and Pos Logistics have been affected. 
Pos Malaysia said in a statement today that despite the current situation, the group continues to protect its 15,000 front liners and operational support employees' livelihood and ensure that their needs are prioritised.
The group was responding to recent commentaries that surfaced on social media and the news recently. It, however, did not specify which media commentaries it was referring to.
"The Covid-19 pandemic is a global issue that is affecting supply-chains worldwide, causing the weakening or closing of businesses and the loss of livelihoods for many. Malaysia is also not excluded from this global crisis.
"While many severely impacted sectors in the country resorted to salary reductions, job cuts or other drastic measures, Pos Malaysia continues to strive hard in ensuring that these employees’ future are protected. Pos Malaysia is currently undergoing a transformation process to turn the business around. As our transformation plan progresses and situation has improved, we will ensure better rewards for our people.
"At the same time, while the business is adjusting to the new normal, we continue to carry out our responsibility and serve the country as an essential service provider during this challenging time. This spirit is embedded in our DNA and is our obligation under the Universal Service Obligation,” Pos Malaysia said.
The group said it is also grateful for the collective effort by its employees, who worked tirelessly to ensure deliveries and services are carried out with minimal disruptions, especially towards the Hari Raya Aidilfitri festive season.
"Pos Malaysia hopes for the continuous support from the public and we also hope that they understand the difficult challenges that we must endure during this difficult time,” the company said.
At the midday break today, Pos Malaysia's share price settled down one sen or 0.93% at RM1.06 for a market capitalisation of RM829.74 million. The stock saw some four million shares traded.
Malaysia’s MCO, which was initially scheduled between March 18 and 31, requires non-essential businesses to stop operations, while the public has been ordered to stay at home to curb the Covid-19 outbreak.
On March 25, Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said the government decided to extend the MCO until April 14, because updates from the National Security Council and Health Ministry indicated an increase in Covid-19 cases. On April 10, Muhyiddin said the government was extending the MCO until April 28.
On April 23, he said the MCO will be extended for another two weeks until May 12. 
On May 10, the premier said the MCO, currently with loosened restrictions under the conditional MCO, will be extended to June 9.
