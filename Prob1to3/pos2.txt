KUALA LUMPUR (Aug 10): Microlink Solutions Bhd is developing an insurance policy renewal digital platform and innovation channel for Pos Malaysia Bhd over a nine-month period.
In a bourse filing today, Microlink said it received a letter of award (LOA) from Pos Malaysia last Friday for the project. Under the agreement, the national postal company will share 12% of its net revenue generated from the software usage with Microlink.
The duration of the project encompasses three months of development and deployment, with another six months for the Pilot Go-Live stage, it added.
Microlink will need to integrate the platform with Pos Malaysia's existing digital channel.
"The services will commence from the date of acceptance of the LOA," Microlink said.
Microlink shares closed up two sen or 1.04% at RM1.95 today, bringing a market capitalisation of RM359 million.
