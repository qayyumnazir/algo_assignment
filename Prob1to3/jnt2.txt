On Feb 5, the employees had resumed their normal working status and actively sorted and processed the packages of customers," it said.It said J&T will not deduct or owe employees a penny of wages, and hereby declare that they are willing to accept the supervision and inspection by the public and institutions.The company also said due to the rapid increase in package volume during the MCO period, J&T took on more packages from the community during this period.It added that the company hired more temporary workers and only provided simple training for the temporary workers' SOP."This is indeed a fault in our management. We have formulated special regulations and management methods for settlement of claims and supervision of similar incidents, and fast settlement of lost packages."We are grateful to the public for their love and support for J&T. We have always spared no effort to improve our services and internal management," it said, adding that reforms were made in the shortest possible time over the past few days, including staff expansion, vehicle expansion and management supervision.It said that its management goes to the grassroots for training to ensure the quality working behaviour of all employees."We will bear all the responsibilities, quickly improve our management and service standards, and provide professional training to our own employees for reliable and efficient express service to the Malaysian users."We deeply know that frontline employees are the greatest asset and we would like to thank our frontline employees for their continuous efforts to provide delivery services to the public," it said.
