KUALA LUMPUR (March 30): The world’s leading international express service provider, DHL Express predicts that the business-to-business electronic commerce (B2B e-commerce) market will grow by more than 70% to US$ 20.9 trillion by 2027.
In its Whitepaper on B2B E-commerce, DHL also predicted that 80% of all B2B sales interactions between suppliers and professional buyers will take place in digital channels by 2025. 
“The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the pace of digitalisation and the purchasing behaviour of technology-savvy millennials, who are now of an age to be the professional B2B decision-makers, are the main drivers of this global e-commerce growth,” it said. 
Business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce volumes within the DHL Express network increased in 2020 by approximately 40%, compared to 2019. 
The positive development saw the company closed its financial year 2020 (FY2020) with the best results in its more than 50 years history, with a total revenue of 19.1 billion euros (RM93.09 billion), up 11.9% year-on-year.
DHL Express chief executive officer John Pearson said even in times of worldwide shutdowns, globalisation has shown its resilience, fuelled by digitalisation and the power of global trade.
“These trends have led to an ever growing number of consumers to shift their shopping activities online,” he said.
