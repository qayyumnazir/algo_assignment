KUALA LUMPUR (May 18): DHL Express has so far distributed more than 200 million vaccine doses internationally to over 120 countries, involving over 350 facilities. 
DHL chief commercial officer and head of customer solutions and innovation Katja Busch said over 50 bilateral and multilateral collaborations with partners in both the pharmaceutical industry and public sector were forged and several new dedicated services were formed to stem the task. 
"Logistics and supply chain management play a key role in pandemic management. Keeping supply chains running and ensuring delivery for essential health supplies provided valuable lessons.
"We rolled out new dedicated services for the vaccine distribution at unprecedented speed. All sectors, industries, and nations must work together to successfully end the acute phase of this pandemic," she said in a statement released after the virtual media briefing on the new DHL Whitepaper, "Revisiting Pandemic Resilience" today.
Also present at the media briefing was the vice president of Life Sciences and Healthcare for Europe, Middle East and Africa, DHL Customer Solutions and Innovation, Thomas Ellmann. 
Meanwhile, DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei managing director Julian Neo said a huge effort is needed behind-the-scenes to manage and optimise the entire process, from the manufacturer through to the people who need it the most. 
"With our extensive logistics expertise in the life science and healthcare sector, we are proud to have delivered more than two million doses to Malaysia and continue to play an active role in the country's pandemic response," he said.
